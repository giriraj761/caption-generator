Image Caption Generator with React, TensorFlow, ANN & Soft Computing\
Project Overview:

This project is an Image Caption Generator developed using the React framework in conjunction with TensorFlow, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Soft Computing techniques. It allows users to upload images, which are then processed through a sophisticated neural network model to generate descriptive captions for the uploaded images.

Key Features:

User-friendly interface for uploading images\
Powerful neural network model trained on large datasets\
Generates accurate and descriptive captions for uploaded images\
Flexible and customizable architecture\
Built with modern technologies and frameworks
